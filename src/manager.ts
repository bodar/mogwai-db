// The graph-lifecycle seam. `GraphManager` is the runtime-specific half of the
// management story: creating, inspecting, and destroying whole graphs. The
// shared `makeRouter` (router.ts) dispatches HTTP verbs onto it, so the two
// runtimes present an identical management API. Everything platform-specific
// (a Bun in-process registry vs a Cloudflare Durable Object namespace) hides
// behind this interface, mirroring how `Sql` hides the SQLite transport.
//
// Semantics are idempotent and create-on-demand, matching Cloudflare's model:
// addressing `/gremlin/{id}` at all brings the graph into existence (a DO springs
// into being on first access; the namespace has no "does this exist?" query).
// So no verb 404s on a well-formed id — GET/POST auto-create an empty graph,
// PUT is create-if-absent, DELETE is a no-op when there's nothing to remove.
